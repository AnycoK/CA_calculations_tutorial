# CA_calculations_tutorial
This is an introduction to work with the main code for the reconstruction of X-ray fluorescence imaging data measured with the coded aperture.
In principle it should be possible to work with this minimum example, which includes an example picture, whose projection can be simulated and a real projected picture, that can be reconstructed.
The tutorial tut1 uses the artificial data, the tutorial tutorial_real_data uses an example of real data.
